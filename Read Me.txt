The actual CNN model labeled (DogsVsCatCNN) is in the folder as a Jupyter file and a .py file.
The DogsVsCatCNN.py file can just be opened on any compiler (PyCharm, Spyder, etc.)

The Predict.py file had issues as a Jupyter file, so I left it as is. To run it, you can open it in any python compiler. Instructions on how to use the cat vs dog predictor is written in the .py file. Do not remove anything outside of this folder.
